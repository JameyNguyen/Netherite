# Netherite

## Description
Netherite is an note-taking app designed to help students become more productive. It features many features, and the integration of both Gemini and OpenAI API to power AI features in the app. It also features a proprietary system for cloud hosting for notes using
a private server, and live collaborating editing on the same notes, similar to Google Docs or Word. 

## Trailer
I also edited a screen-recording of a demonstration of the App.

## Visuals
Here's how the log-in page looks like.

The main homepage of the app, where you can access your folders, files (and recent files), and create new folders and files if you wish. You can also auto-index your files, which will auto-organize your files for you and put them into existing or generated folders.

Here's an example of a note opened up in the App. It features auto-saving, markdown for rich text, and features such as an OCR reader to take pictures with and automatically parse them into notes, a voice recorder to record lectures with, and an AI assistant,
who reads the context of your notes and 'your prompt' to help you with any questions you might have.

## Installation
Installation manual still work in progress. I run the frontend/app in Android Studio.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.
