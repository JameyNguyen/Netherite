# Netherite

## Description
Netherite is a note-taking app designed to help students become more productive. It integrates both Gemini and OpenAI APIs to power its AI features. Additionally, it offers a proprietary cloud hosting system for notes using a private server and supports live collaborative editing on notes, similar to Google Docs or Word.
