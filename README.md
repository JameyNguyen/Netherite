# Netherite

## Description
Netherite is a note-taking app designed to help students become more productive. It integrates both Gemini and OpenAI APIs to power its AI features. Additionally, it offers a proprietary cloud hosting system for notes using a private server and supports live collaborative editing on notes, similar to Google Docs or Word.

## Trailer

The main homepage of the app, where you can access folders, files, and recent files. You can also create new folders and files, or auto-index your files to organize them into existing or newly generated folders.

An example of a note opened in the app, featuring auto-saving, markdown support for rich text, an OCR reader for parsing text from images, a voice recorder for lecture recording, and an AI assistant to help with note-related questions.

## Installation
The installation manual is still a work in progress, sorry.

## Usage
For students lol, and anyone who wants to organize their notes

## Roadmap
Future features to be released:
- Port to Web and IOS (React + React Native + Go, or Ruby on Rails)
- Migrate to AWS instead of having a local server (that is on a Pi)
- Update the UI, and wire-frame for Desktop as well
- Encrypt user data to make login/signup safer
- Revamp live editing, which would fight bugs and improve time complexity
- Pitch the app at ISU Entreprenership
